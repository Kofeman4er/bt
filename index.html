            <h1>Basics of Operating a BT Reflex</h1>
            <div class="intro-block">
                <p>Understanding the basics of operating a BT Reflex reach truck is critical for new operators. Below are key principles that will help you navigate safely and effectively. Believe it or not there is an easy way of getting into the correct position. Let's see how it works. Good modern reach trucks can actually turn on the spot. When driving a truck we refer to the pivot point which is the center of the front wheels. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block odd">
                <img src="1.jpg">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>So to line up and pick up that pallet drive forks first so that the pivot point is in line with the center block of the pallet.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block even">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Put on sufficient lock bearing and turn the truck. Your forks are now on target. The general rule of thumb when using your lift and reach mechanisms is to check that the parking brake is engaged ensuring the truck is stable and unable to move during this delicate process. Check how your truck works and ensure the parking brake is always safely engaged. So now let's lift a pallet. </p>
                </div>
                <img src="2.jpg">
            </div>

            <div class="content-block odd">
                <img src="3.jpg">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Always take care when lifting heavy loads at height. Treat them with respect. Think of the damage that can be caused. With normal racking systems and traditional reach trucks there are some simple devices you can use to help you get it right every time. Most modern trucks have height indicators but of course you need to know the height of each beam level in advance. And never forget even with the most advanced machines that allow the best view of high-level handling you must be accurate when it comes to fork heights.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block even">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Another important factor is to consider the size and weight of pallet loads. Pallets can vary in size. Some are 800 by 1200 millimeters, others are 1000 by 1200 millimeters. Some can be used both ways whilst some are free entry and others are fully boarded. Most of the time you may know what to expect in your working environment but don't always assume. </p>
                </div>
                <img src="4.jpg">
            </div>

            <div class="content-block odd">
                <img src="5.jpg">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Think about the load you're carrying. On the ground or in racking where short pallets may be positioned close together hitting and damaging another skid can easily happen. The way round it is to look out for non -standard pallets then mark their position on your forks so you know how far to insert them. So short pallets need to be picked up on the end of your forks but to be safe you need some idea of the weight of the load.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block even">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>The maximum load that your truck can safely lift is based upon the 1200 millimetre long pallet. The load is centered on the halfway point which is 600 millimetres from the heel of the forks. Lifting a short load of the same weight on the end of your forks will create an imbalance. So the further the load is from the heel the lighter it has to be. It's all a question of balance. To balance a longer load the weight must be less than the maximum allowed in the normal position due to the load center shifting away from the heel. Inside your cab is a table of load weights for different load centers. Use it. Think about the load to keep your truck and your feet safely on the ground. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="text">
                    <h3>So let's take on that load from the very beginning. </h3>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ The 90 degree turn. </ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Taking the pivot point to the center point of the pallet and turning the steering wheel to put on sufficient lock.                     </ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Apply the parking brake.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Be careful to check the size of the pallet and weight of the load.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Checking the load center as you go.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Raise your forks and at eye level check the tilt to make sure the forks are level.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Continue raising them until the markers meet or the indicator point is reached. </ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Creep the truck in, brake and finally carefully reach out.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Raise the load a few centimeters then tilt the forks up to stabilize the load and reach in.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Then creep the truck back so that the load clears the racking. And never operate the reach or raise or lower the forks without the parking brake applied.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Lower the load and if it's a short pallet that isn't on the heel of the forks lower it to the floor and reposition it to the heel before driving off.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ The most important thing is to maintain visibility at all times. Always drive with the load behind you unless you're positioning the load to deposit it.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Think about the length of your truck and always drive with the reach pulled in. And think about height.</ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ Always drive with the load as low as practicable. </ul>
                    <ul class = "summary">✓ There is no safe way to carry a load high in the air. Maneuvering with load raised is one of the most dangerous things you can do with your reach truck. It could affect its stability.</ul>
                    <p id = "summary_end">Remember that any damaged vehicle or load costs dearly in expensive repair downtime and in lost revenue. And there may be a personal price to pay too.</p>
